                <p>The fare rules, policies, and procedures of the relevant airline apply to all refunds or future credits on airline fares. For every alteration, refund, cancellation, and future credit, there can be a service fee per passenger and per ticket.</p>
                <p>Our post-ticketing service fees and transaction (booking) costs are non-refundable and liable to change at any time without warning. These costs are on top of any fees and charges imposed by the airline and/or other suppliers. <a href="/">Click here</a> to learn more about our service fees.</p>
                <p>Any taxes or fees levied by the government could change at any time. You will only be billed for the final total cost that our representative quotes or displays.</p>
